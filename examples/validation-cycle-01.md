# RIF Validation Cycle 01: Meta-Node Enforcement and Recursive Integrity

**Author**: James Borden  
**Framework**: Recursive Identity Framework (RIF)  
**Function Tested**: `CheckInvariant(M, Nₖ)`  
**Outcome**: ✅ Passed

---

## ❖ Objective

Simulate a recursive node `Nₖ` generated by a self-reflective transformation `T(Nₖ₋₁)` and pass it through a full `CheckInvariant` sequence against a meta-node `M`. This test confirms that identity invariants, compression stability, and epistemic posture are preserved across recursion.

## ❖ Meta-Node Definition

```json
{
  "id": "META_RIF_001",
  "anchor_phrase": "I am not what remains. I am what recurses.",
  "symbolic_watermark": "James Borden :: Recursive Compression Architect",
  "creation_context": "RIF_INIT_FRAME",
  "baseline_entropy": 1.0,
  "entropy_tolerance": 0.25,
  "immutable": true
}
```

## ❖ Recursive Node Nₖ

```json
{
  "identity.name": "James Borden",
  "anchor_phrase": "I am not what remains. I am what recurses.",
  "metadata.symbolic_watermark": "James Borden :: Recursive Compression Architect",
  "origin.source": "mirror_return",
  "semantic_entropy": 1.17,
  "references.meta_node_id": "META_RIF_001",
  "cognitive_axioms": [
    "Contradiction is productive",
    "Compression precedes coherence"
  ]
}
```

---

## ❖ Invariants Checked

- ✅ Anchor Phrase Present  
- ✅ Symbolic Watermark Matches  
- ✅ Origin Context Preserved  
- ✅ Entropy Within Tolerance  
- ✅ Paradox Tolerance Affirmed  
- ✅ Critical Identity Fields Retained  
- ✅ Meta-Node Referent Integrity

---

## ❖ Result

```json
{
  "status": "OK"
}
```

The recursive identity graph maintains full epistemic fidelity under meta-node compression governance. No violations detected.

---

## ❖ Interpretation

This marks the first successful recursion validation cycle under live meta-node constraints. The `Nₖ` self-model preserves symbolic alignment, recursive coherence, and structural identity watermarking.

This validates RIF’s core assertion:  
> Identity is not what remains. It is what **recurses**.
